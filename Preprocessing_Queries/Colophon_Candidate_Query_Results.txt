But, the name of the occupant, of the see of Antioch is left blank, perhaps because of the contention between Dionysius VII and John bar Ma'dān. See Assemani, Bibl. Orient., t. ii. p. 376 etc.

A more recent Nestorian hand has altered the text in numerous passages, so as to bring it more into accordance with the ordinary Peshitta of the time. For instance: fol. 10 a, S. Matth. ch. vii. 17, we now read ܗܟܢܐ ܟܠ ܐܝܠܢܐ ܛܒܐ ܦܐܪ̈ܐ ܫܦܝܪ̈ܐ ܥܒ̇ܕ instead of ܦܐܪ̈ܐ ܛܒ̈ܐ; fol. 12 a, ch. ix. 29, ܘܐܡ̣ܪ ܠܗܘܢ̇ ܐܝܟܢܐ, the word ܠܗܘܢ has been erased; fol. 15 a, ch. xii. 16, ܘܐܲܣ̣ܝ ܐܢܘܢ has been altered into ܘܐܲܣ̣ܝ ܠܟܠܗܘܢ; fol. 16 b, ch. xii. 45, ܘܗ̇ܘܝܐ ܐܚܪܝܬܗ has been changed by erasure into ܘܗ̇ܘܝܐ̇ ܚܪܬܗ; and so on. The same person has added numerous Syriac vowels, diacritical points, and marks of punctuation, besides a few notes, referring to matters of pronunciation and grammar: e. g. fol. 14 b, ܫ̇ܪܝܘܿ ܡܵܠܓ݁ܝ̣ܢ, marg. ܩܫ. ܓ. ; fol. 18 a, ܕܢܐܩܕܘܢ (orig. ܕܢܩܕܘܢ), marg. ܐܝܟ ܓ. ܩܪܝ ܩ.; ܒܬܠܬ ܣܐܝ̈ܢ marg. ܐܣܩ . ܐ .; fol. 19 a, ܐ̇ܝܡܟܐ ܠܗ ܗܟܝܠܠܗ̇ܢܐ ܗ̇ܠܝܢ ܟܠܗ̈ܝ̇ܢ., marg. ܡ܏ܫ (i. e. ܡܫܐܠܢܐ); fol. 62 b,ܕܠܵܛܬ݂, marg. ܓ܏ܢܘ. ܛ.

Gr. 926, A.D. 615), when Mār Basha was metropolitan of Nisibis, Mār Matthew head of the college, Mār Aha lecturer, and Mār Bar-Sahde teacher.

The various readings are either from other copies of the Pěshittā (܏ܒܨ, i.e. ܒܨܚܚܐ), or from the Harklensian version (ܚܪܩܠܝܐ, ܚ܏ܪܩor ܒ܏ܚܪܩ). The notes are mostly explanatory of single words in the text, and introduced by ܏ܗ, i.e. ܗܳܢܰܘ. Occasionally, however, writers are cited; e.g. Basil, fol. 90 b; Severus, fol. 90 b; Philoxenus, ܡܪܝ ܐܟܣܢܝܐfol. 116 a, ܦܝܠܠܟܣܝܢܘܣfol. 161 b; Theodosius, ܬܐܘܕܘܣܝfoll. 137 a, 157 a; and the abbat Bar-Gagai, ܪܝܫܕܝܪܐ ܒܪܓ݁ܰܐܓ݁ܰܝ, fol. 85 a.
